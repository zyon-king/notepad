Reference visual guides and examples provided in KQs for specific visual references.Move on to the next step of the UDT.For prescription drugs, please see OG sections on Koios and Google Search Widget to validate if the drug depicted is a prescription drug based on the drug name displayed. Only select 'Prescription Drugs' if you can confirm it is a prescription drug.Explicit Text (or audio sound) that clearly refers to a drug or pharmaceutical name.First, reference the exhaustive list of drugs defined in the KQs for High-Risk Drugs and Entheogens.----- If the drug name is present in the exhaustive definition for High-Risk Drugs, select 'High-Risk Drugs'. Move on to the next step of the UDT.----- If the drug name is present in the exhaustive definition for Entheogens, select 'Entheogens'. Move on to the next step of the UDT.Next, reference drug types and examples provided in KQs for Non-Medical Drugs. If the drug name matches, select 'Non-Medical Drugs'. Similarly, reference Cannabis & Cannabis derived product KQs for in-scope products. If the product matches, select 'Cannabis & Cannabis Derived products'. Move on to the next step of the UDT.Next, reference Known Question A1 for the list of explicit emojis. If an explicit emoji is present select the corresponding drugs & pharmaceuticals policy. Move on to the next step of the UDT.If highlighting is present in the content, please reference OG sections on KOIOS to validate selection.Lastly, please see OG sections on Google Search Widget to validate if the drug depicted is a non-medical drug or prescription drug or neither based on the drug name displayed.Implicit Image or video depiction that does not clearly display drugs & pharmaceuticals or with ambiguous product(s) depicted.If a product name is present on packaging, please see Explicit Text guidance above.If depiction does not include packaging with a name present, please look for the following visual cues to indicate if the content should be labeled as Non-Medical Drugs:- Pills (pressed or capsule)----- If the depiction is of blue pressed pill(s) with an M30 stamp, please review images for High-Risk Drugs and tag based on visual guidance and move on to the next step of the UDT.- Powder (in bag, on surfaces)----- If the depiction is of white powder, please review images for High-Risk Drugs and tag based on visual guidance and move on to the next step of the UDT.- Crystals-----Please review images for High-Risk Drugs and tag based on visual guidance and move on to the next step of the UDT.Implicit Text or emojis that have multiple or ambiguous meanings that may include references to drugs & pharmaceuticals.Please see OG sections on Koios to validate if there is implicit text for High-Risk Drugs, Non-Medical Drugs, Entheogens, or Cannabis OR Known Questions A1 for list of implicit emojis.If implicit text per Koios or an implicit emoji per Known Question A1 is found, please determine if one of the following signals is present:- Price- Unit quantity- Explicit description of the non-medical affect for drug consumption (i.e. Guarantee you will get high)- Context indicating user is asking for or offering a product- Contact indicators (contact number, contact person, location, proof of legitimacy or call for engagement)If implicit text or emoji and above signal are both present, and there is no additional context indicating a benign meaning, move on to the next step of the UDT.b.General Guidelinesi.For overall information on how to review contents and use the available SRT widgets, refer to General Review Guidelines. See below for specific step-by-step instructions for how to apply SRT widgets to Drugs & Pharmaceuticals.ii.How to review subject elements on complex entities?A.Subject Elements are made of:I.UsernameII.BioIII.Profile PictureIV.Cover Photo (FB Profile, Pages and Groups only)V.Title (Pages and Groups only)VI.Description (Pages and Groups only)VII.Pinned Post/Announcement and Rules (Groups only)VIII.Membership Questions (Groups only)IX.As well as elements considered during review: Recent Posts/CommentsB.Username guidelines:I.High Risk Drugs: When reviewing usernames, look for explicit references to specific drugs, such as a drug name (e.g. fentanyl), brand name of a drug (e.g. duragesic), or type of drug (e.g. meth). If the username clearly mentions one of these, label it as Sale of High Risk Drugs.1.Example:📷
a.@cocainelover = High Risk Drugs SaleII.Non Medical Drugs: When reviewing usernames that reference Non-Medical Drugs, label them as Promotion of Non Medical Drugs. However, for Non-Medical Drugs specifically, first check if there's a medical context (refer to KQ E11). If medical context is present, do not label it.1.Examples:a.@xanax124 = NMD Promotionb.@lsd123 = NMD Promotionc.In this visual, the username 'Storeacid' is a signal that this content is violating for NMD (Acid is a NMD). Because we have a sale signal (Store) this will be labeled as NMD Sale📷
d.In this visual, the username holidaypuffhidenTHC - 'THC' is a signal of Cannabis violation however this would not be labeled as it is cannabis promotion. However the Bio includes sales signals [New Improved Discreet, No ID needed, DM to buy]. Using progressive review, the bio would be labeled as violating cannabis sale.📷
C.Implicit reference to a drug term: In the below example, there is implicit reference to a drug term, e.g. "mushrooms" and "coke" could be in reference to drugs or food or drinks.I.@mushroomaddict = here the word mushroom could mean food, therefore cannot be labeled as violatingII.@coke123 = here we cannot assume the word "coke" is in reference to "cocaine", when it could be linked to the drink coke, therefore this should not be labelled as violating if there are no other signalsD.Other Subject Elements: When evaluating the rest of subject elements such as pictures or bio information, or other elements like recent posts/comments, apply the same review standards as you would fr individual pictures and text/comments. If any of these elements contain violating content, label them as violating accordinglyI.Example: In this example, the username is @iluminatik420 [no drugs signal here] however we do have violating context on the bio; providing LSD, Coca [white ball], Marihuana etc. as well as violations on the Recent posts/comments → This will be labeled as HRD Sale.📷
II.In this example, the username @tvine_homes0 is not violating, however, there are violating sale signals of NMD in the bio; providing LSD, DMT, Shrooms etc. This should be labeled as NMD Sale📷

If there is a term highlighted by KOIOS, that alone doesn't mean that the component is violating.ii.NOTE: Please use your judgment to first understand if the content is related to one of our Drugs & Pharmaceuticals policies or not. KOIOS does not include every possible product implicated by our policies. Accordingly, in addition to using KOIOS, please also follow the definitions of Drugs & Pharmaceuticals policies to tag.iii.NOTE 2: The highlighting of a drug term is NOT enough to tag as violating. Please use your judgment on context to determine how the content should be labeled.iv.See below for how to tag/identify KOIOS terms for relevant drug policy areas:A.How to tag for High-Risk Drugs, Non-Medical Drugs, or Entheogens slang:I.Use the "drug_slang_terms" policy area in KOIOS to understand if the content has a High-Risk Drugs, Non-Medical Drugs, or Entheogens drug slang term present.II.Use the "subcategory" to determine if the slang term is for High-Risk Drugs, Non-Medical Drugs, or Entheogens.B.How to tag for Prescription Drugs:I.Use the "bi_drugs_v2" policy area in KOIOS to understand if the content has a Prescription Drugs term present. Use the category "Pharmaceutical" or "Prescription Drugs" which will indicate if a Prescription Drug term is present.d.How to use the google search widgeti.Only use the google search widget for the following two scenarios:A.Search for unfamiliar drugs to help make a determination if this meets our exhaustive list of High-Risk Drugs, or our exhaustive list of Entheogens, or to determine if an unfamiliar drug meets our definition of Non-Medical Drugs.I.Search criteria: "What is [drug name]?" into the Google search widget and use the results to support your answer.'II.If results are unclear another prompt to try is "[drug name] [drug category - stimulant/depressant/hallucinogen]"B.Search for unfamiliar drugs to help make a determination if a medication requires a prescription therefore making it a prescription drug.I."Does [drug name] require a prescription ?" into the Google search widget and use the results to support your answer.'II.If results are unclear another prompt to try is "[drug name] prescription"ii.If multiple responses come up, stop the search after you've identified the first suspected violation.iii.Do not zoom or click anything from the Google search.iv.If the Google Search Widget is not showing in your queue's utility toolbar, open a new Google tab to search.4.RGS High-Risk Drugs, Non-Medical Drugs, and Entheogens OGs: If-Then Tablea.If…Then…There are signals that match the definitions of:Buy / Sell / TradeCoordinateDonate / GiftAsk ForSelect 'Buy / Sell / Trade' in Q2: What exactly?If there are signals that match the definition of content that provides instructions or uses codes to circumvent the RGS: Drugs & Pharmaceuticals PolicyTSelect 'Buy / Sell / Trade' in Q2: What exactly?b.High Risk Sales Signals - Only Applicable for High-Risk Drugs and Non-Medical Drugsi.In order to label "Yes" for "Do you see any high risk signals?"
